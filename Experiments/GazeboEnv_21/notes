	REWARD_TIME=0.3

Food: 60
Bots: 2
Time: ~22 hours

Notes:
Very similar to _20, consulted with Anil and Kai and updated sensors are essential. This run saw more updated sensors than _20 which is why it did slightly better but they ultimately ended in the same way.
For next experiment will be fixing episode time, removing speed reward and have throttled /gazebo/model_states which was causing a massive drop in speed.
