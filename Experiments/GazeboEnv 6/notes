Bots: 12
Time: ~15 hours

Notes:
Post fix of diff_drive_control (before wheels had no weight, and when instructed continually to move forward would spin. Now goes in almost a straight line). However robots do not continually go forwards so are extremely slow so never encounter rewards.
Going to make the robots slightly faster so that they encounter some rewards (this run had Validation Agent receiving a reward on average every 210 seconds which is far too long).
