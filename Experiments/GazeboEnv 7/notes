Food: 90
Bots: 12
Time: ~40 hours (but ran for 3 days?)

Notes:
Gave agents reward for going forwards but they all end up in corner. Negative reward near wall + no food near wall not enough to beat quick reward of going forwards.
rostopic echo /swarmbot1/cmd_vel shows almost entirely forward command.
Need to try a simpler task first.
Uprighted each episode.
