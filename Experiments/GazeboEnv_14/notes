Food: 0
Bots: 2
Time: ~22 hours

Notes:
Ran exact same setup as with GazeboEnv_13 - perhaps it would have worked if I left it long enough.
However, robots could no longer just learn to turn when near things, as food gives reward. I did see evidence of turning while near things policy but it was taking time to develop.
In _13 and _10 robots only turned when they were stationary on the wall, I saw no evidence of turning when approaching a wall which would have been a better strategy. To test this I have added 2 new commands - turn left move forward, turn right move forward (so 5 commands). Next experiment will be test of this.
