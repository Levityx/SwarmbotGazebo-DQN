Food: 60
Bots: 2
Time: ~48 hours

Notes:
Reduced sensor range to 2 and ran for longer with no improvement.
Going to try:
1. Check timestamps of sensors
2. Add reward for how green the pixels are
3. Only use one camera with a 90 degree fov
4. Remove the 'right' and 'left' commands so only 'forward', 'forward-right' and 'forward-left' remain
5. Spawn food infront of the robot? Will be a pain to implement
6. Try with SpatialConvolution on Kai's PC, and with just linear on my PC
