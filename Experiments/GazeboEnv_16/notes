Food: 0
Bots: 2
Time: ~34 hours

Notes:
5 commands with no walls, two robots and food that surrounds them as they move. Didn't get a chance to check their behaviour and still unsure why low scores are acheived.
Going to run the same setup but for 3x as long, going to further lower weight of food, going to add mouth part to robot.
